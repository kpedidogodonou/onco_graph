# Onco Graph

This project connects a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to a **Knowledge Graph built from the GDC Data Portal**, enabling natural-language exploration of large-scale cancer clinical data.

The Knowledge Graph aggregates **complete clinical records for thousands of patients** across diverse cancer studies, including demographics, diagnoses, and related clinical information. Users can ask questions in plain language, and the system translates them into structured queries to retrieve accurate answers from the graph.

## Features
- Knowledge Graph derived from GDC clinical data
- Natural-language question answering powered by an LLM Agent
- SPARQL-based querying under the hood
- Interactive Streamlit interface
- Designed for transparency, exploration, and research support

## Data Source
- **GDC Data Portal**: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/

## Use Case
This tool is intended for **data exploration, research support, and educational purposes**, making complex clinical datasets easier to query and understand.
