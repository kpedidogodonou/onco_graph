# Onco Graph [https://oncograph.streamlit.app/]

This project connects a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to a **Knowledge Graph built from the GDC Data Portal**,  for more accurate and verifiable Question-Answering Agent.

The Knowledge Graph aggregates **clinical records for thousands of patients** across diverse cancer studies, including demographics, diagnoses, and related clinical information. Users can ask questions in plain language, and the system translates them into structured queries to retrieve accurate answers from the graph.
